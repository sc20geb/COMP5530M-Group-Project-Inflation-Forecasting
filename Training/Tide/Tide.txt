Tide  Time-series Dense Encoder
Simplicity and efficiency using MLP and encoder and ecoder based model
Encoder takes in covariates, finding hidden representations then decodes these to map future predictions.
faster than more xomplex transformer models

Handles both static and dynamic covariates. 
Uses MLPs to capture non linear dependencies
Has residual block, one hidden layer with ReLu, and skip connection which is linear
